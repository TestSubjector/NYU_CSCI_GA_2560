# CSGI GS 2560
My submissions for the 4 lab assignments of NYU's Artificial Intelligence Course. 
Each folder has code that can runs independently. Every folder also contains a README with more information on how to run the specific lab code.
The contents of each folder are as follows:-

## CSCI-GA.2560 Lab 1

Contains the code for three search algorithms
* Breadth First Search
* Iterative Deepening Search
* A* Search

## CSCI-GA.2560 Lab 2

Contains the code for three modes

* A generic DPLL solver
* A BNF to CNF converter
* Takes BNF and solves it by running the above two steps

## CSCI-GA.2560 Lab 3

Contains the code for
* Markov Process Solver

## CSCI-GA.2560 Lab 4
